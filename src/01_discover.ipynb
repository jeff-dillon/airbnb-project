    "## 1. Short Term Rental Metrics Research\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick google search gives us some of the key metrics used to evaluate the \n",
    "financial performance of a short term rental property. NOI and RPP appear to be\n",
    "most related to our goal of finding a good investment property.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Net operating income (NOI)** is another key Airbnb metric for Airbnb hosts to evaluate the profitability of their listing. NOI measures the total revenue generated by a property from all sources and subtracts operating expenses, including management, maintenance, and cleaning fees. Hosts can use NOI to accurately determine their net profit and make informed decisions about pricing strategy, cost-saving measures, or investing in property improvements. By focusing on maximizing their NOI, hosts can drive profitability on the Airbnb platform and make sure they achieve sustainable success. Therefore, tracking NOI is an essential factor for any host looking to optimize their financial performance and grow their vacation rental business.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Revenue per property (RPP)** calculates the total earnings generated by a property within a defined timeframe. Monitoring RPP allows hosts to discern which listings are the highest revenue generators, enabling them to fine-tune pricing and marketing strategies accordingly. Furthermore, RPP aids hosts in assessing the financial feasibility of investing in new properties or enhancing existing ones. By optimizing RPP, hosts can enhance operational efficiency on Airbnb and thrive in the fiercely competitive vacation rental market. Tracking RPP becomes a pivotal aspect for hosts seeking to maximize financial performance and expand their business endeavors.\n",
