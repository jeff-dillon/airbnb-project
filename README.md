# Airbnb Data Analysis

This is a capstone project for the Code:You Data Analysis course. This project 
will analyze Airbnb data to uncover useful correlations/trends and guide 
decision making in investing in STR properties.

**Goal:**
Determine the optimal neighborhood / size / price for investment.

Steps:
1. List (or research) key metrics for Short Term Rentals.
2. Determine data needed to support.
3. Review available data.
4. Identify the type of analysis that can be done and list the questions that can be answered.
5. Clean the data.
6. Analyze the data and answer the questions.
7. Visualize the analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open the `src/01_discover.ipynb` file to view the raw data.



## Capstone Project Criteria

1. This README file provides information about the project and how to use the code.
2. `data/README.md` provides data dictionary for the data used in the project.
3. `src/01_discover.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook using pandas to understand the raw data files.
4. `src/02_clean.py` use pandas to clean a dataset
5. `src/realestate.py` create custom classes and methods

## Project Layout

- `README.md`: general information about the project
- `data/raw`: raw data files
- `data/clean`: cleaned data files
- `data/README.md`: data dictionary
- `src/01_discover.ipynb`: jupyter notebook for data discovery
- `src/02_clean.py` : automated the data cleaning
- `src/realestate.py` : custom module with real estate properties and methods
